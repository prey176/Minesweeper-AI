# Minesweeper-AI
Minesweeper Game with an additional AI assistance.


This project was a part of the course CS50AI. The UI part was prewritten and was provided. The major working part was working on the AI part.

There are two main files in this project: runner.py and minesweeper.py. minesweeper.py contains all of the logic the game itself and for the AI to play the game. runner.py has been implemented for you, and contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. You should be able to run python runner.py to play Minesweeper (or let your AI play for you)!
